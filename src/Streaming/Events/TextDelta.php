     * line instead of being run together mid-sentence.
     *
     * The boundary is the step's own `StreamStart`, not a change of message ID.
     * A provider that cites its sources closes the text block at every citation
     * and opens the next one mid-sentence, so grouping by message ID broke a
     * cited answer into a paragraph per clause.
